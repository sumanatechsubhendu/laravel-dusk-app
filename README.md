## End-to-End Testing with Laravel Dusk

Conducting end-to-end (E2E) testing with Laravel Dusk allows you to automate browser interactions and ensure your application works as expected. Below are the steps to set up Laravel Dusk for a Laravel application, focusing on writing E2E tests for typical CRUD operations on a product.

### Steps:

1. **Create a Separate Laravel Application and Configure Laravel Dusk**

   Start by creating a new Laravel application and installing Laravel Dusk to facilitate browser-based testing.

2. **Write E2E Tests for the Following Scenarios:**

   - **Create Product**: 
     - Test the creation of a new product.
     - Ensure validation errors are handled correctly and inform users if inputs don't meet the requirements.
   
   - **Read Products**:
     - Test viewing all products.
     - Test accessing and displaying a single product's details.
   
   - **Update Product**: 
     - Test updating details of a product.
     - Ensure validation checks are in place and function as expected.
   
   - **Delete Product**:
     - Test the functionality to delete a product.
     - Confirm that the product is removed from the database.

3. **Database Verification:**

   - Each test should verify that the database reflects the expected changes post-operation.
   - Confirm that the application state aligns with CRUD operations, ensuring data integrity.

### Conclusion

Utilizing Laravel Dusk for E2E testing helps ensure comprehensive coverage of your application's functionality. By performing tests that simulate real user interactions, you can catch potential issues early and maintain a high quality of user experience.


## End-to-End Testing with Laravel Dusk

End-to-end (E2E) testing with Laravel Dusk allows you to automate browser tests to ensure that your application behaves as expected. Below is a guide on how to set up Laravel Dusk for your Laravel application and write E2E tests for typical CRUD operations on a product.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Laravel Application

#### 1. Create a New Laravel Application:

If you haven't already, create a new Laravel application:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel laravel-dusk-app
```

Navigate to the new Laravel project directory:

```bash
cd laravel-dusk-app
```
Install Laravel Dusk via Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev laravel/dusk
```

After installing Dusk, run the install command:

```bash
php artisan dusk:install
```

Set Up the Testing Environment:
Ensure your .env.dusk.local is configured properly to use a test database.

Run database migrations for your test environment:

```bash
php artisan migrate --env=testing
```

Step to check current laravel version in my case it is Laravel Framework 11.21.0:

```bash
php artisan --version
```
Step to check current node version in my case it is v22.4.1:

```bash
node -v
```

#### 1. Install Laravel Jetstream::
Use Composer to require Laravel Jetstream into your project:

```bash
composer require laravel/jetstream
```

Using Inertia (With Vue.js):

```bash
php artisan jetstream:install inertia
```

#### 2. Run NPM Install and Build Assets:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
#### 2. Create a Dusk Test:
Create a test class for registration testing:

```bash
php artisan dusk:make RegistrationTest
```
